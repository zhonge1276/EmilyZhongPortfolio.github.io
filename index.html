	<h1>About Me:</h1>
	<h2>Hi! My name is Emily Zhong, and I am a 9th grader at Canyon Crest Academy. I was born in San Diego, and have lived here ever since. I love San Diego because of it's mostly good weather of clear blue skies, along with it's beautiful beaches. I hope to go to UCLA for college, because it is my dream school that I have been wanting to go to ever since I was a little girl.</h2>
	<h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
	<h2>I have many hobbies which include dancing, playing squash, baking, and reading. I have been dancing for about 6 years now, and am currently attending Inspired Movements Dance and Performing Arts. About four months ago, I decided to try out squash, and liked it so much that I have been playing ever since. I also love baking desserts in my free time, and my favorite thing to bake is layered cakes. Another hobby of mine is reading, and currently my favorite books are the Harry Potter Series. I also enjoy playing the piano and violin.</h2>
	<h1>Favorite Food:</h1>
	<h2>My favorite foods are Italian and Japanese food. :)
